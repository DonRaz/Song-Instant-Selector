| **BPM Range Filtering** <br> ![BPM Range Demo](https://github.com/DonRaz/Song-Instant-Selector/blob/main/demos/4Jun2023/BPM%20Range%20Demo.gif?raw=true){:height="500px" width="300px"} <br> The BPM is a filter, it will only display songs that within the given BPM Range. This feature is best for DJs who want to quickly find mixable tracks. | **Tag Filtering** <br> ![Tags filtering](https://github.com/DonRaz/Song-Instant-Selector/blob/main/demos/4Jun2023/Tags%20Filtering%20Demo.gif?raw=true){:height="500px" width="300px"} <br> Filters out the songs that don't have all the tags required. I use it instead of playlists - So instead of creating a playlist of Rock, Happy songs that will fit a Pool party, I just select those tags and get all the corresponding tracks within seconds. |
