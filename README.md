# Song Instant Selector
This is a simple web application that allows users to select a mood and then displays a list of songs that are predicted to be enjoyed by the user in that mood. The code uses the Spotify API to retrieve a list of songs that are associated with the selected mood. The code then uses a machine learning model to predict which songs in the list are most likely to be enjoyed by the user. The code then displays a list of the predicted songs to the user.
