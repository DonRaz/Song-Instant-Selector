| Feature | Demo | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Energy Sorting | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DonRaz/Song-Instant-Selector/main/demos/4Jun2023/Energy%20Demo.gif" width="250"> | The energy level is a sorting mechanism. It will reorder song list based on each song's closeness to the desired energy. **Energy Guidelines:** 1 = lay down, 3 = Nod your head, 5 = lightly dance, 7 = Dance and move, 9 = Jumping and dancing like crazy! |
| Popularity Sorting | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DonRaz/Song-Instant-Selector/main/demos/4Jun2023/Popularity%20demo.gif" width="250"> | The Popularity level is a sorting mechanism. It will just reorder the song list based on the closest energy. **Popularity Guidelines:** 1 = Nobody knows, 3 = Only Artist's fans will know, 5 = Only Genre's fans will know, 7 = Many people will know a part of the song, 9 = Most of the people will know and sing most of the song |
| BPM Range Filtering | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DonRaz/Song-Instant-Selector/main/demos/4Jun2023/BPM%20Range%20Demo.gif" width="250"> | The BPM is a filter, it will only display songs that within the given BPM Range. This feature is best for DJs who want to quickly find mixable tracks. |
| Tag Filtering | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DonRaz/Song-Instant-Selector/main/demos/4Jun2023/Tags%20Filtering%20Demo.gif" width="250"> | Filters out the songs that don't have all the tags required. I use it instead of playlists - So instead of creating a playlist of Rock, Happy songs that will fit a Pool party, I just select those tags and get all the corresponding tracks within seconds. |
