## BPM Range Filtering
![BPM Range Demo](https://github.com/DonRaz/Song-Instant-Selector/blob/main/demos/4Jun2023/BPM%20Range%20Demo.gif)

The BPM is a filter, it will only display songs that within the given BPM Range. This feature is best for DJs who want to quickly find mixable tracks.


## Tag Filtering
![Tags filtering](https://github.com/DonRaz/Song-Instant-Selector/blob/main/demos/4Jun2023/Tags%20Filtering%20Demo.gif)

Filters out the songs that don't have all the tags required.
I use it instead of playlists - So instead of creating a playlist of Rock, Happy songs that will fit a Pool party, I just select those tags and get all the corresponding tracks within seconds.
